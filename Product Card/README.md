# Product Card Project

A responsive UI Product Card with modal window component.

This project was built using HTML, CSS/SASS and JavaScript, focusing on accessibility as well.

### My editor and extensions

I've used [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as the editor.
As the extensions, I've used [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) and [Sass](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Syler.sass-indented).
